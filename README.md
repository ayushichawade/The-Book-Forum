 Application System with Hybrid Filtering and Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering and Autoencoders<br>

#About the Project<br>
The digital era has transformed how we discover and engage with books. This project focuses on creating a book recommendation system that leverages advanced recommendation techniques such as autoencoders, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering algorithms. The system is designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user ratings, reading history, and behaviors. In addition to these, the system includes various features to enhance user experience and engagement, such as: <br>

1. Popular book recommendations
2. Genre-based suggestions
3. Wishlist creation
4. Book uploads by users (as authors)
5. Admin portal for efficient moderation
6. User forum for book discussions
<br>
By offering a seamless and interactive reading experience, this system fosters increased user satisfaction and platform engagement.

#Features
1. Personalized Book Recommendations: The system uses autoencoders and collaborative filtering to generate personalized reading suggestions.
2. Hybrid Filtering: A combination of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques provides more accurate and diverse recommendations.
3. User Wishlist and Book Uploads: Users can create personal wishlists and upload books, adding a dynamic social component to the platform.
4. Admin Portal: Allows for efficient management and moderation of uploaded books by administrators.
5. Discussion Forum: Enables users to discuss specific books and chapters, enhancing the community aspect of the platform.

#Research Paper
This project is built on the principles discussed in the published paper:<br>

"Enhancing Book Recommendations in Android Applications Using Autoencoders and Hybrid Filtering" <br>

The paper explains how autoencoders, a type of neural network, can be combined with collaborative filtering to generate personalized recommendations. It also explores hybrid filtering algorithms, which enhance recommendation accuracy by integrating multiple recommendation models.
