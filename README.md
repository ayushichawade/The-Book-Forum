##About the Project
The digital era has transformed how we discover and engage with books. This project focuses on creating a book recommendation system that leverages advanced recommendation techniques such as autoencoders, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering algorithms. The system is designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user ratings, reading history, and behaviors. In addition to these, the system includes various features to enhance user experience and engagement, such as:
