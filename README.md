# The-Book-Forum
 Application System with Hybrid Filtering and Recommendation using Collaborative Filtering and Autoencoders<br>

# About the Project<br>
The digital era has transformed how we discover and engage with books. This project focuses on creating a book recommendation system that leverages advanced recommendation techniques such as autoencoders, collaborative filtering, and hybrid filtering algorithms. The system is designed to provide personalized book recommendations based on user ratings, reading history, and behaviors. In addition to these, the system includes various features to enhance user experience and engagement, such as: <br>

1. Popular book recommendations
2. Genre-based suggestions
3. Wishlist creation
4. Book uploads by users (as authors)
5. Admin portal for efficient moderation
6. User forum for book discussions
<br>
By offering a seamless and interactive reading experience, this system fosters increased user satisfaction and platform engagement.
<br>

# Features

1. Personalized Book Recommendations: The system uses autoencoders and collaborative filtering to generate personalized reading suggestions.
2. Hybrid Filtering: A combination of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques provides more accurate and diverse recommendations.
3. User Wishlist and Book Uploads: Users can create personal wishlists and upload books, adding a dynamic social component to the platform.
4. Admin Portal: Allows for efficient management and moderation of uploaded books by administrators.
5. Discussion Forum: Enables users to discuss specific books and chapters, enhancing the community aspect of the platform.

# Paper Abstract

The paper delves into advanced recommendation techniques within Android applications. It covers how collaborative filtering analyzes user interactions and how hybrid filtering combines different recommendation models to improve accuracy. In addition to personalized recommendations, the system provides genre-based suggestions, a wishlist feature, and a forum for user discussions, highlighting the innovative application of machine learning in the book industry.

# Introduction
A recommendation system is an information filtering system that provides personalized suggestions based on users' preferences and past behavior. Such systems are widely used across various platforms, including e-commerce websites, streaming platforms, and online marketplaces.

This project leverages collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to improve recommendation accuracy and user engagement. Hybrid techniques overcome the limitations of single-method recommenders and provide a comprehensive recommendation solution.

Furthermore, the system incorporates neural networks and deep learning techniques (e.g., autoencoders) to analyze complex patterns in user behavior, allowing the recommendation system to become more accurate and adaptive over time.
